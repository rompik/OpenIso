# OpenIso
OpenIso is an open-source, lightweight graphical editor designed specifically for creating and managing piping isometric fitting symbols.  It bridges the gap between manual sketching and complex CAD suites, providing a streamlined environment for designing Symbol Keys (SKEYs) and component graphics used in industrial piping isometrics.
