.. This helps us keep translations up to date without needing to edit the code directly.

How to contribute:

    ```
    Visit our project page on Crowdin.
    
    Select a language you are proficient in.
    
    Start translating the available strings. You can also vote on translations provided by other contributors.
    
    Once translations are ready, they will be automatically submitted to this repository via a Pull Request.
    
    Note: Please do not submit translation Pull Requests directly on GitHub. All text changes should be handled through Crowdin to prevent synchronization conflicts.
